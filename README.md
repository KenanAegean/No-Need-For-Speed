Assignment Developing a Simple Networked Game Using Unity's NGO
Due 17 January 2025 23:59
Instructions
Objective: The goal of this assignment is to create a simple networked game using
Unity's Netcode for GameObjects (NGO). The project will involve setting up a clientserver architecture, implementing basic synchronization, and ensuring stable
replication of game objects.

Requirements:
  1. Game Design:
      o Create a simple multiplayer game. Suggestions include:
        ▪ A basic top-down shooter.
        ▪ A simple racing game.
        ▪ A basic platformer.
      o The game should support at least two players (one host and one client).

  2. Networked Game Features:
      o Implement a client-server model.
      o Ensure player movement is synchronized across the network.
      o Synchronize at least one other game object (e.g., projectiles, NPCs).
      o Implement in game communication (e.g., chat messages, emotes).
      o Implement server authority to handle game state and synchronization.

Steps:
  1. Project Setup:
      o Create a new Unity project.
      o Add the Netcode for GameObjects package via the Package Manager.
      o Set up a basic scene with a player prefab and necessary game objects.
  2. Network Manager:
      o Add a NetworkManager to your scene.
      o Configure the NetworkManager to handle player connections and object
      spawning.
  3. Player Movement Synchronization:
      o Create a player prefab with a NetworkObject component.
      o Implement a basic movement script that uses Unity’s Input system.
      o Synchronize player movement across the network using NetworkTransform or a custom script.
  4. Game Logic:
      o Add additional game logic such as shooting, scoring, or checkpoints.
      o Ensure all relevant actions are synchronized across the network.
  5. Server Authority:
      o Implement server authority to manage game state.
      o Ensure all critical game logic (e.g., scoring, player death) is handled on the server.
  6. Testing and Optimization:
      o Test the game with multiple players.
      o Optimize the network code to ensure smooth performance.
      o Handle common network issues such as latency and packet loss.
  7. Documentation:
      o Document the development process.
      o Include explanations of how synchronization, server authority, and optimizations were implemented.

Deliverables:
  1. A GitHub link with the complete Unity project.
  2. A built executable of the game for testing.
  3. A written report (2-4 pages) detailing:
      o Overview of the game design.
      o Implementation details of the network features.
      o Challenges faced and solutions implemented.
      o A reflection on the learning experience.

Evaluation Criteria:
  • Functionality:
      o The game runs smoothly with multiple players.
      o Player movements and game objects are synchronized correctly.
  • Network Implementation:
      o Proper use of Unity's Netcode for GameObjects.
      o Effective client-server communication and server authority implementation.
  • Optimization:
      o Efficient network message handling.
      o Minimal latency and smooth gameplay.
  • Documentation:
      o Clear and comprehensive report including.
  ▪ Struggles and issues.
  ▪ Reflections on the development process.

Submission:
Submit a link to your GitHub repository with the Unity project folder, built executable,
and the written report.
